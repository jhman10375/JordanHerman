    <h2>Alpha Phi Omega - Delta Alpha</h2>
    <p>During the spring semester of 2022 I rushed Alpha Phi Omega at the University of Cincinnati. 
      During this semester I learned more about the fraternity and its values of service, friendship, 
      and leadership which aligned with my values and continued to persue this organization. After 
      I was a brother I became very active in planning a fundraiser and other events to help sustain 
      the chapter, additionally I served as a voting delegate at Sectionals, a conference for the 
      region which brought several chapters together to foster brotherhood, service, and leadership 
      in an inclusive enviornment. Lastly at the end of the spring semester, I was elected to be the 
      Vice President of Membership where it would be my role to plan and lead our membership 
      initiative and work with the rest of the chapter to continue to work on our community outreach 
      efforts.</p>

    <h2>Robotics</h2>
    <p>In High School I joined the Robotics team as a freshman and began working on the software that our robot wwould need in order to drive and complete tasks, during my softmore year I began working on the hardware and design of the team's robot and eventually became the captain, a position i maintained for the following three years. I worked closely with our advisor to schedule work times, organize our teams materials and digital data, budget and fundraise, and assist in all behind the scenes team work. In 2018 we placed 2nd in our third competition and maintained a top 25% record at all other competitions since 2017. During my four years apart of the team and three years as captain i learned how to lead a team, work with an advisor and school administration, budget for parts, tools, and competitions, problem solve, build robots with Vex Robotics parts and tools, program using RobotC, and collaborate with a team. In Middle School I competed in two First Lego League Competitions and placed 7th in both. My time on this robotics team was spent mainly focused on the projects where I worked to create an educational Instagram page that would inspire a new use for the popular social media site. Our other project focused on recycling programs and reevaluating current procedures and allowed recycleables to make it easier for the typical consumer to recycle and help save the planet. Our latest robot from 2020 can be seen on the right.</p>
    <h2>Heart of Ohio BBYO</h2>
    <p>In 8<sup>th</sup> grade i first joined my local BBYO chapter, Heart of Ohio. When i had initially joined i did not enjoy the events, the people, or the message that the group was sending. Later i found out that i would have the opportunity to run for leadership positions where i could make a change and turn the chapter into a wecoming place for all new and current members. I began these changes by becoming the lowest leadership position where i started as the treasuerer, i created new spirit wear, donated money to breast cancer research, and raised a significant amount of money to assure the chapter would have money for future events and activities. I continued my leadership by being elected vice president of the chapter. In this job my role was to plan all activities and events, communicate with the president and other chapters about ideas and collaboration efforts, develop a strategic calendar, and communicate major events to members and their families. Following my time as vise president i was no sooner elected president, now i was on top, i had the ability to lead the other board members in a new direction of respect, friendship, and service. In this position i reorganized how we met for executive decisions, passed several motions which created new board positions and opportunities, established the calendar i had created as a calendar to be used throughout our region of chapters in Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio, tripled membership, more than doubled our conference and meeting attendance, and led the chapter to win several prestigious international awards within BBYO. This group taught me how to collaborate with others, work with advisors and organizations to plan events and follow the groups initiatives, communicate with members and their families of all ages, make friends, and so much more.</p>

<h2>Wexner Service Corps</h2>
<p>When I was a junior i was refered to apply to join the Wexner Service Corps. Wexneer Service Corps is a service youth group funded by Lex Wexner with the intent to give local Columbus juniors and seniors the opportunity commit different acts of service and understand how easy it is to make an impact on the world as well as relate the service work back to jewish text and readings. When I joined this group i was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to go to Houston Texas and help out with the post hurricane Harvey relief efforts. This experience was jaw dropping, i had the opportunity to help provide underwear to children in need, help rebuild two houses, work in a food pantry, and other places needing help during this traumatic time. I was then selected as a senior leader the following year where i had the chance to go to Detroit Michigan and help with different programs like helping to create a couple of parks in lower income areas, assisting in food pantries, and serving as a leader and role model to the geeneral members. I helped with morning activities, loading and unloading busses, and leading groups in other activities and service programs.</p>

    <h2>Robotics</h2>
    <p>In High School I joined the Robotics team as a freshman and began working on the software that our robot wwould need in order to drive and complete tasks, during my softmore year I began working on the hardware and design of the team's robot and eventually became the captain, a position i maintained for the following three years. I worked closely with our advisor to schedule work times, organize our teams materials and digital data, budget and fundraise, and assist in all behind the scenes team work. In 2018 we placed 2nd in our third competition and maintained a top 25% record at all other competitions since 2017. During my four years apart of the team and three years as captain i learned how to lead a team, work with an advisor and school administration, budget for parts, tools, and competitions, problem solve, build robots with Vex Robotics parts and tools, program using RobotC, and collaborate with a team. In Middle School I competed in two First Lego League Competitions and placed 7th in both. My time on this robotics team was spent mainly focused on the projects where I worked to create an educational Instagram page that would inspire a new use for the popular social media site. Our other project focused on recycling programs and reevaluating current procedures and allowed recycleables to make it easier for the typical consumer to recycle and help save the planet. Our latest robot from 2020 can be seen on the right.</p>
    <h2>Heart of Ohio BBYO</h2>
    <p>In 8<sup>th</sup> grade i first joined my local BBYO chapter, Heart of Ohio. When i had initially joined i did not enjoy the events, the people, or the message that the group was sending. Later i found out that i would have the opportunity to run for leadership positions where i could make a change and turn the chapter into a wecoming place for all new and current members. I began these changes by becoming the lowest leadership position where i started as the treasuerer, i created new spirit wear, donated money to breast cancer research, and raised a significant amount of money to assure the chapter would have money for future events and activities. I continued my leadership by being elected vice president of the chapter. In this job my role was to plan all activities and events, communicate with the president and other chapters about ideas and collaboration efforts, develop a strategic calendar, and communicate major events to members and their families. Following my time as vise president i was no sooner elected president, now i was on top, i had the ability to lead the other board members in a new direction of respect, friendship, and service. In this position i reorganized how we met for executive decisions, passed several motions which created new board positions and opportunities, established the calendar i had created as a calendar to be used throughout our region of chapters in Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio, tripled membership, more than doubled our conference and meeting attendance, and led the chapter to win several prestigious international awards within BBYO. This group taught me how to collaborate with others, work with advisors and organizations to plan events and follow the groups initiatives, communicate with members and their families of all ages, make friends, and so much more.</p>

    <p>Students do not get enough sleep to be successful in school. There are three factors related to where a student’s time is spent, technology, social opportunities, and studious activities. Social opportunities include school plays and athletics, activities with friends, youth groups, and more. These opportunities are equally important to school as life will require the ability to work with others. Technology allows people to connect through instant messaging and social media allowing people in China to instantly communicate with people in Mexico. Studious activities include studying for classes, tutoring peers, and communicating with educators about ideas, passions, and questions. Technology has opened the door to shared educations between educators around the world. One educator included, “when technology is introduced into the classroom, it becomes one of the many classroom instruments within the grasp of educators and students, and credible researchers have indicated that isolating the impact of technology from the "human factor" in the classroom is a formidable challenge. (Canuel).” Preventing use of technology in the classroom will lead to deficits in education as technology will be essential for modern learning through activities, word proceesing, and communication. Technology allows for mass communication; nobody is out of reach when a Wi-Fi signal and mobile device is present. Students can contact with pen pals in foreign countries and can collaborate for mutual understanding of different cultures and languages, students can contact businesses and future places of work to gain information and interviews for projects, and students can formulate their own ideas found from information and research done across the world. Students can find simulators for science projects, software to build 3d models, and type well written and edited papers. Essentially technology provides ease of access to resources and information.</p>
    <p>Technology in modern society is used by millions of people all over the world, although everyday use is different for everyone, society pushes technology into a few main categories, access to information, social interaction, and individualized activities. The future will be built on technology which will be further utilized in education. Technology has the power to bring information to a user’s pocket, when mixed with education, it allows for students to learn about anything that a students’ curiosity leads to. Technology will create the future, but for technology to become this essential education on technology is needed, “nine out of 10 students indicated that using technology in the classroom would help prepare them for the digital future.§ By teaching students skills like PowerPoint, you can help set your students up for success. Introducing instructional technology in the classroom at a young age can help prepare students for future digital demands (“Top 5 Benefits of Technology in the Classroom”).” This source speaks to the idea that technology will only continue to develop and education will need to use it in order to educate on the uses of it as well as access the powerful resources and communications technology provides. Technology is also a tremendous resource for educators as it contains numerous online activities, interactives, and worksheets. Thanks to these resources education can evolve with technology and education will no longer be individualized; curriculems can be merged, lessons shared, and students gaining understanding based on their needs opposed to their teachers needs. Individualized teaching and accomodations can be provided to students as teaching styles can easily be shared and compared.</p>
<p>While technology is always improving, time users spend on technology is also increasing. Teenagers put their whole life into their mobile devices leaving them vulnerable to outside comments and self approval. This typically leads to either a spread of positivity and hope, for instance when users share words of encouragement or share the idea of wearing a mask due to the world wide pandemic, but it also leads to cyber bullying and harrasment. These outside comments have caused a dramatic increase in anxiety and stress which has made users more eager to check comment sections and seek instant approval for posts and ideas. While Ehmke was speaking about popular social networks she includes, “Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram all led to increased feelings of depression, anxiety, poor body image and loneliness.”Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are currently ranked in the top 30 free United States applications in the Apple Store and are all relatively high on that list, which means that across the country millions of users are actively using these apps. </p>

<p>It can then be assumed that a large percent of these users will have a higher chance of facing critical feelings such as depression and anxiety. With these applications hosting so many users it can be perceived that many of the users spend a lot of time looking for outside approval which will lead to a major distraction in daily life. zzthis can be proven during a bell change in a high school or middle school, typically students can not use their devices in the classroom, but when class time ends students first checvk their phones, than get their backpacks and supplies ready to go. I would imagine that teachers will say the biggest distractoon to students is their devices. Old fashioned teachers will tell stories of their former students passing notes and spitballs, today students send texts and bash eachother on snapchat.
Technology is not as good as it seems. While technology has opened the world to instant access to knowledge and instant verification from friends and people around the world, there are many harmful effects as well. Muhammad Gadit added: </p>
<p> As this source concludes, brain cancer is now being considered a side effect of the antennas used in cell phones. Thus continued use of these devices may lead to students developing brain cancers which will obviously affect their ability to learn, function, and live. Essentially these devices could kill us. Scary to imagine answering the phone and then realizing there is a chance of a tumor beginning to grow. Blue light emitted from mobile devices is another harmful emission from technology, as more time spent on it means more blue light going into the body. Carole Gan explains:</p>
<p>  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  “Continued exposure to blue light over time could <br />  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  damage retinal cells and cause vision problems <br />  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  such as age-related macular degeneration. It can<br />  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  also contribute to cataracts, eye cancer and <br />  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  growths on the clear covering over the white <br />  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  part of the eye. According to a study funded <br />  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  by the National Eye Institute, children are<br />  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   more vulnerable than adults because their eyes<br />  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   absorb more blue light from digital devices. <br />  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Exposure to blue light before bedtime also can <br />  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  disrupt sleep patterns because it affects when <br />  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  our bodies create melatonin. (Gan)”</p>
<p>With use of technology ever increasing and blue light emission not decreasing, all that can happen is an increase in damaged vision leading to higher use of supportive, magnified, and contact lenses. Other side effects include fatigue, stress, depression, ADHD symptoms, anxiety, obesity, addiction, and more. With many users being school age, these users often lack strong attention spans and often lack the ability to study for comprehension. Students can however use quick memory which is only helpful for a quiz not full understanding. Students believe that their mobile device usage is productive as it is typically used for social media and simple communications, but they do not realize how dangerous these devices are. These devices will continue to be major distractions in daily life as well as brain tumor incubators and vision killers.
</p>
	<h4>Social Network Use by Age since 2005</h4><img src="SMA.jpg" style=" width:495px; height: 450px;">
	<p>This graph ilustrates the how use of technology has grown very quickly especially in the lower age ranges.</p>
	<h4>Correlation of Mental Health to Social Media</h4><img src="MHSM.PNG" style=" width:495px; height: 450px;">
	<p>Google shows that social media did not initially effect mental health but around 2009 it became an esential factor of mental health. This information can be used to infer that social media will create more metal health, and as seen above younger age groups use technology more. Furthermore, it can be concluded that students are the direct target of mental health due to usage of social media.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>To conclude, technology and daily distractions consume a significant amount of time which could be utilized for sleep which will lead to better functioning students which allows them to learn more in school and perform better in all aspects of life. The world keeps turning, technology keeps advancing, and access to information becomes easier, as all of this happens there continues to only be 24 hours the day, how the world will continue to utilize their time may lead to less sleep or could lead to advancements in sleep technology making less sleep as equalto a full night of sleep. Cancer, blue light vision deficits, depression, anxiety, etc. will soon be a major topic of study as users will soon be in critical condition as the list of side effects will only grow. If students continue to use devices at the current rate, a typical student will soon develop these cancers, vision deficits, and worse, which will lead to bigger distractions in school and a deficit in education. The more students use technology the better their understanding of information, their use of learning to their own style, and their use of an improved mindset on the application of information. Where will modern technology go? Technology has created a new world, a world where information is at a user’s fingertips, a world where sleep can be tracked on a monitor which displays any discrepancies and apneas, a world where advancements could cure cancer, different uncurable vision problems, mental health issues and ultimately technology could fix its own problems. A full night of rest is essential for students to wake up and be cognitively functioning for a full day of learning and activity. Without enough sleep comprehension skills, proper judgment, essential skills needed to get through each day are sincerely tampered. Is the world prepared to learn how to live with the consequences of many activities and lack of time?</p>

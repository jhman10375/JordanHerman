    <h2>The Jewish Community Center of Greater Columbus</h2>
    <p>In the life of a typical student, work, study and play, is the average schedule, how to do it all in a 24 hour day and include necessities such as eating, sleeping, and maintaining self-care is not easy. Working 20 or more hours a week, taking a hard course load, and managing a social life is very draining, and our bodies need time to rest and recharge, but when these activities take too much time, it leads people to not be ready for the new day ahead. Several studies have proven that lack of sleep will right away affect cognitive ability and judgement and over a prolonged period could lead to obesity and diabetes. Without sleep students have been proven to not perform as well the following day. Another distraction in the day includes use of technology, most modern countries use technology for everyday social interactions and personal use, and with the improvements to technology comes the advancements to different health consequences which include insomnia (sleep issues) and brain tumors (cancerous cells developing in the brain). Technology is an incredible source of information; it takes a lot of our time as we enjoy “binge watching” Netflix, making TikTok videos, and mindlessly scrolling through different websites in search of information on celeberties like Kim Kardashian, and these activities can distract us from our real life activities and interactions. Between lack of sleep and use of technology I found the question of how do distractions such as activities and technology affect student preparedness and overall performance in class and how does sleep affect mental and physical health of student?</p>

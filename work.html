	  <h2>BMW Group</h2>
	  <h4>Full Stack Developer Co-Op</h4>
		  <p>In this role my main job requirements consited of developing full stack web aplications, maintaining Azure Security scores, and shadowing my team for internal use at both BMW Group and Rolls Royce Motor Cars. My primary work consited of managing a servers security score on Microsoft Azure which included creating new endpoints, ensuring encryption and software status was up-to-date, and working with Microsoft Support to troubleshoot Microsoft Azure Cloud Defender errors, in addition to working on UI/UX for multiple applications, and completing back-end trainings. In addition to this work I led a development team through the creation, brainstorm, proposal and pitch, and proof-of-concept process needed to push an idea which is intended to save an estimated $300,000 per year in just on plant. I worked with a team to help facilitate the implementation of a new resource management and booking system. I rolled out a training kiosk which incorporated an interactive way for users to view learn a new process which was supported by a fellow intern creating a training room which housed a physical replica of the process we were training on. Lastly, I worked with other associates in my building and the main plant to begin planning for a can drive which will hopefully bring in over 75,000 cans as well as a putt-putt event which will help raise money for a local charoty in Greenville South Carolina. 
			  In this roll I learned several new skills including networking, C#, MySQL, Azure, and more.</p>
		  <h4>Global Digital Solutions Co-Op</h4>
			  <p>In this role I began by completing a month long Angular 12 training to begin my front-end development career. Once completed I assisted in several projects updating UI/UX. Towards the end of the term I competed in the Think.Make.Start competition, an internal competition to bring a collaboration of associates on different problems to find new innovations and solutions to help the company. As a new project had begun to take form I had been brought in to discuss a plan of attack as we would need to create an access point for users on the floor with the approach to use Near Field Communication (NFC) tags as the contact. I immediately found interest in this as I found I may be able to apply some of my hardware background to this project, so I along with another intern were tasked with doing research and looking into options. After understanding how YubiKey authenticators worked and utilized NFC I realized I might have had a solution. I met with my team and pitched the idea which was met with great success as our senior most developer had intended on creating both a web application and mobile application but now realized that this would not be needed. The last piece of this puzzle was to understand a mobile device compatibility and options including form submission and camera uploads. To confirm that I had a solution I created multiple demos to test both form submission and camera 
				  options to which i had found great success. I now met with my team, the project owner, and several soon to be users who all found this solution to be both brilliant and effective. In this competition i served as a lead developer on an Oracle Apex site which was used to create a inventory management system, a notification system for down time, a new form which would condense the current process from seven into one, and created a better tracking system for upper management to review progress. On the side of this project I worked with a few interns on a new intern onboarding application which would make it easier for managers, interns, and intern management to be able to onboard and check the status of the process. Lastly, I worked with my tea and department manager to create a tracking system for available time throughout the year incorporating project estimates, vacations, and office closure. This system had initially been proposed as an application to which I would be developing so i created an arcitectural diagram, fully immersive wireframe, and met with our cloud team to understand data and storage options. Ultimately this project was canceled and became an excel sheet which i used several macros to create an interactive visualization tool to view availability. In this role I learned new skills including Angular, networking and profesionalism, Oracle Apex, Oracle Sql, 
				  VBA, Agile Project Mangement Methodoloigies, how to understand a process from different perspectives, effective communication skills, and more.</p>

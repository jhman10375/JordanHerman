	  <h2>BMW Group</h2>
	  <h4>Full Stack Developer Co-Op</h4>
		  <p>In this role my main job requirements consisted of developing full stack web aplications, maintaining 
			Azure Security scores, and shadowing my team for internal use at both BMW Group and Rolls Royce Motor 
			Cars. My primary work consisted of managing a servers' security score on Microsoft Azure which included 
			creating new private endpoints, ensuring encryption and software status was up-to-date, and working with 
			Microsoft Support to troubleshoot Microsoft Azure Cloud Defender errors, in addition to working on 
			UI/UX for multiple applications, and completing back-end trainings. In addition to this work I led a 
			development team through the creation, brainstorm, proposal, pitch, and proof-of-concept process 
			needed to push an idea which is intended to save an estimated $300,000 per year in just one plant by 
			creating a new automated scheduling tool for production associates. I 
			worked with a team to help facilitate the implementation of a new resource management and booking system. 
			I rolled out a training kiosk which incorporated an interactive way for users to view learn a new process 
			which was supported by a fellow intern creating a training room which housed a physical replica of the 
			process we were training on. Lastly, I worked with other associates in my building and the main plant 
			to begin planning for a can-drive which will hopefully bring in over 75,000 cans as well as a putt-putt 
			event which will help raise money for a local charity in Greenville South Carolina. In this role I 
			learned several new skills including networking, C#, MySQL, Azure, and more.</p>
	  <h4>Global Digital Solutions Co-Op</h4>
		  <p>In this role I began by completing a month long Angular 12 training to begin my front-end development 
			career. Once completed I assisted in several projects updating UI/UX over several pages. Towards the end of the term I 
			competed in the Think.Make.Start competition, an internal competition to bring a collaboration of 
			associates on different problems to find new innovations and solutions to help the company. As a 
			new project had begun to take form I had been brought in to discuss a plan of attack as we would need to 
			create an access point for users on the floor with the approach to use Near Field Communication (NFC) 
			tags as the contact. I immediately found interest in this as I found I may be able to apply some of my 
			electrical engineering background to this project, so I along with another intern were tasked with doing research and 
			looking into options. After understanding how YubiKey authenticators worked and utilized NFC, I found that I would be able to use simple queries and our database namiing system to create this link between the NFC tag and the user. The last piece of this puzzle was to understand mobile 
			device compatibility and options including form submission and camera uploads. In addition to this research I also created several demos to test and explore mobile device compatibility with our application and use cases. In the Think.Make.Start. competition I served as a lead developer on an Oracle 
			Apex site which was used to create a inventory management system, a notification system for down time, a 
			new form which would condense the current process from seven into one, and created a better tracking system 
			for upper management to review progress. On the side of my main job functions, I worked with a few interns on a new 
			intern onboarding application which would make it easier for managers, interns, and intern management to 
			be able to onboard and check the status of the process. Lastly, I worked with my team and department managers 
			to create a tracking system for available time throughout the year incorporating project estimates, vacations, 
			and office closure. This system had initially been proposed as an application to which I would be developing 
			so I created an arcitectural diagram, fully immersive wireframe, and met with our cloud team to understand 
			data and storage options. Ultimately this project was canceled and became an excel sheet which I used several 
			macros to create an interactive visualization tool to view availability. In this role I learned new skills 
			including Angular, networking and profesionalism, Oracle Apex, Oracle Sql, VBA, Agile Project Mangement 
			Methodoloigies, how to understand a process from different perspectives, effective communication skills, 
			and more.</p>

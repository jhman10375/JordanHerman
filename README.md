# ReadMe
Welcome to the repository of my personal website
I have created this page repository to make my 
site open-source and viewable. This site was originally 
created in 2017 and has since been adapted to share 
updated information about me.

Files found in the Outdated files folder include several 
formerly used files and images when this site originated 
back in 2017. Files currently used are still being 
modified to fit standard practice and maintain current 
information.

I am currently using Netlify to host this site for free
I have used W3 Schools as a main resource for new ideas
and components.
I am using GitHub as my main repository
This site uses Google Analytics to monitor views

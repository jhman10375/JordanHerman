	<h4>Ropes Course Director</h4>
	<p>In the summer of 2021 I was brought back to the JCC as a senior counselor responsible for assisting with all ropes course related functions and activities for the season. This began with an intense training where we learned the ins and out of the course, safety plans, and emergency procedures. At the conclusion of this training I successfully completed dozens of practice rescues of my staff which would ensure that I would be prepared when faced with a real emergency with your children. In addition to the practice rescues, we took a written examination and based on my scores I was named Ropes Course Director where it would be my job to ensure the best practices and safety checks were completed in addition to creating new trainings for my staff, and educating our kids on how to be on the course safely. Outside of my course responsibility, as my role would be to challenge our kids at a new level I was also responsible for creating and leading teambuilding and leadership activities for the kids.</p>
	<h4>Camp Counselor</h4>
	<p>In the summer of 2016 I began volunteering at the JCC summer camps where I started being trained as a camp counselor. I was taught how to interact with children and their families, how to create an environment that welcomed creativity, curiosity, and courage, and how to work with others. The following summer and for the next three years I was hired on as staff working with incoming 1<sup>st</sup> grade students helping them to make friends, try new activities, and learn about themselves. I was given the opportunity to work different camp programs and extra weeks including after camp programs, pre-camp recruitment events, and circus camps. After four years in this position, I personally worked with over 500 children of ages 4 through 14.</p>

	<h4>Birthday Party Coordinator</h4>
	<p>Starting in the fall of 2017 I was hired as a Birthday Party Coordinator where I worked with families to decorate, prepare, and lead birthday parties for children across Columbus. I helped to prepare food, gather party favors and decorations, and direct parties through different activities. </p>
	<h4>Youth Worker</h4>
	<p>In 2017 I was hired on to staff as a youth worker helping in all departments including the preschool, our two other locations, recreation and sports, and the kitchen. Through all of this I was trained and certified extensively in customer service, food service, and childcare.</p>

In this job I learned food safety skills and was also fortunate enough to be very well trained as a chef.</p>
